<h1>Flowers</h1>
<p>
Flowers' importance in nature is everywhereâ€”they can feed insects, birds, 
animals and humans; provide natural medicines for humans and some animals;
and aid in a plant's reproduction by enticing outside pollinators.
Without flowers, plants would merely be green, and the world would be a duller place.
